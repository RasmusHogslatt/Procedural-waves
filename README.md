# Procedural-waves
Used OpenGL + ImGui in C++ to write a procedural wave generator based on gerstner waves. I also added boxes floating atop of the waves. A plane made of triangles were sent to shader to generate the wave shapes, and singular vertices were sent to the geometry shader to generate boxes with normals in the shader. Below is a video of the running application.
